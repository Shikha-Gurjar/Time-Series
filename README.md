# Time-Series
A time series is a sequence of numerical data points in successive order. A time series tracks the movement of the chosen data points, such as a securityâ€™s price, over a specified period of time with data points recorded at regular intervals.Time series forecasting uses information regarding historical values and associated patterns to predict future activity. Most often, this relates to trend analysis, cyclical fluctuation analysis, and issues of seasonality.
